5,Perfect product!,"It’s a must buy who is looking for an upgrade from previous generation of iPhones.

5,Highly recommended,"Amazing camera quality as expected, battery also has very good performance. Display, body, and touch experience is the best I’ve ever had.

So I would definitely recommend it for everyone who are looking for it, just go for it without delay.

The most amazing thing it the delivery. Flipkart has delivered it in the span ...

5,Highly recommended,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.
If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.

5,Must buy!,"I rate this product 5* as it has got amazing user experience with the best performing A13 bionic processor. The screen responds and graphics rendering is top notch.

You can call me a loyal Apple customer or whatever but I won’t stop praising the products and overall experience. That user experience matters and is worth every penny you pay.
